      <p>Hey! I'm Bella! I’m an MSU student with a double major in Graphic Design and Experience Architecture and a Dance minor! I’m fueled by my passion for technology, problem-solving, and being creative! Currently, I am the Director of Education on the E-Board for my dance group, Orchesis. I am also a Graphic Designer for VIM, the school's fashion magazine. Lastly, I am a member of Gamma Epsilon Tau, the graphic design fraternity here on MSU’s campus.</p>

        <h5>MSU Online Client Project</h5>
        <p>This project was for my XA 242: Introduction to Experience Architecture class. This was our final project, that we worked on for half of the semester. We were placed into groups of 4 and had to analyze the msu.online website. From there, we worked with Kaitlyn Andary, a Digital Marketing Coordinator on the Online Program Management Team; to make suggestions for what we would like to change on the website. At the semester's end, we gave her a presentation, suggesting our ideas. At the moment, she is reworking the website, taking into account the suggestions we presented.</p>

      <h5>DAN 351 Final Project</h5>
      <p>In my DAN 351: Rhythm and Movement class, we had a final project to describe what dance means to us. However, she wanted us to use our passions and knowledge to create something personal. I, being a double major in graphic design and experience architecture opted to create a video. The video is presented below.</p>

<h5>Work Experience</h5>
<h4>Summer Camp Counselor</h4>
<p>Willoway Day Camp</p>
<p>June 2023-August 2023</p>
<p>I worked as a camp counselor for the summer of 2023. I was in charge of taking care of kindergarteners. Everyday, I would create activities for them to do, watch over them in the pool, and overall make sure they are safe while having a good time at camp.</p>
<h4>Barista</h4>
<p>Starbucks</p>
<p>June 2022-August 2022</p>
<p>I worked as a full-time employee for the summer of 2022. I worked the drive-through, cashier, food, and bar making all drinks. We were very understaffed, so I was put on the bar most days of my 35-40 hour work week because I was quick to learn the drinks and could execute them properly. I worked efficiently, and in a timely manner to carry out superb customer service.</p>
